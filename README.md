The Simon game consists of a circular device with four large buttons, each a different color: red, blue, green, and yellow. The game starts by lighting up one of the buttons and playing a corresponding tone. The player must press the same button. The game then lights up the first button again, followed by a second button, and the player must press both buttons in the correct order. This sequence continues to grow longer and more complex as the game progresses, testing the playerâ€™s memory and attention.
